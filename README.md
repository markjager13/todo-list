# Simple ToDo-List App

A simple todo-list created using Create React App for the purpose of solidifying my understanding of React. 

At this time there is very little / no styling. The focus is currently on React fundamentals (components, hooks, etc.). Styling may be added later.

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.
